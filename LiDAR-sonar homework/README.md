# LiDAR-sonar Player-stage simulation 

For this task assigment, the objective is object detection using sonars and also using LiDARS. With that, we can use a translation-rotation model and have a 
global map of the specific zone. For this assigment, I used player-stage functions to get all the sensor data.
